# Dotfiles

Configuration and tools for my macOS dev machine.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedcho/dotfiles/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Notes

Monaspace 1.2+ include Nerd Fonts which makes the icons look too small on the terminal. To fix that, clone the repo, checkout v1.101, and drag the `fonts/otf` directory into Font Book.
